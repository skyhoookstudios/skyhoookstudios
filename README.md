- 👋 Hi, I’m @skyhoookstudios
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, SEO/SEM, graphic design, and soon Web Application development and Mobile application development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS3 (especially), as well as more JavaScript, and then Kotlin/C#/Objective-C.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really anything listed in my interests, but definitely in the mobile app development world. Not looking for a stereotypical ad-based cash grab as much as a reliable, well-made service/application for mobile devices.
- 📫 How to reach me alex.arsenault@gmail.com or skyhoookstudios@gmail.com
